'''
Currently not used, Removed the include in listing_details and added manually
the form template, because I can't include this in every form since this is specific for the
new listing form.

{% for field in listingform %}
    <div class="form-group">
        <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
            <span class="text-danger small">{{field.errors}}</span>
        </div>
        <label class="control-label col-sm-2">{{field.label_tag}}</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">{{field}}</div>

{% endfor %}
